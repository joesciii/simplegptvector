# Simple GPT / Vector DB interfacing

Majority of base functionality from here https://github.com/greg643/gpt

Testing how far GPT can add functionality to this.

Apparently pinecone isn't needed https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb

But for now is used.

### Prerequisites

For Python, you will need most of these, might as well install them all:

```python
pip install pdfminer.six requests pytesseract openai requests nltk bs4 xmltodict pinecone-client tiktoken pdf2image markdown plotly
```
