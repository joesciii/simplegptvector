# Simple GPT / Vector Database interfacing with UI

Majority of base functionality from here https://github.com/greg643/gpt including chunking and interfacing with apis.

Testing how far GPT can add functionality to this.

Apparently pinecone isn't needed https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb

But for now it's used. You need an OpenAI API key & a Pinecone env with API key. Make these env vars in the code if you want, hardcoded atm.

### Prerequisites

lots. check imports.
